&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came across this [website](https://shunsuke-tech.eu/how-to-convert-bxl-file-to-kicad-library-file) after spending way to long creating my own footprints for some parts I gathered off of TI's website.
The free tool is called [Ultra Librarian Binary Reader](https://www.ultralibrarian.com/products/desktop).  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It allows you to convert the .bxl of TI's model and convert it into KiCad (or other ECAD software).
I have noticed that in KiCad 5, the schematic symbol does not come out correctly.  All the pins line up on top of each other.  Maybe this will be updated in the future, but right now, I do not have a fix for it.
