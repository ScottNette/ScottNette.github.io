<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
Goal of the project is to make a lightweight GPS logger that has a few different functionalities.

<ul>
  <li>SD Card writing/reading</li>
  <li>BLE to transfer data to a smart phone</li>
  <li>Temperature, humidity, and pressure measurement</li>
  <li>60+ hour battery life</li>
  <li>E-Ink display</li>
</ul>

One of my favorite additions to this project is the inclusion of pogo pins for the Li-ion battery.
