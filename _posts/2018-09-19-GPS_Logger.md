Goal of the project is to make a lightweight GPS logger that has a few different functionalities.  I couldn't find a GPS tracker that had the features I was looking for, had the battery life or was reasonably affordable.  
I started this project a couple years back, but I have been constantly been changing the design, form factor and features.  Currently the design uses  a few breakout boards for convenience.  The end goal is to remove those
and reduce the overall form factor.  The next biggest upgrade will be switching to a Nordic based uC to further reduce the form factor and for built in Bluetooth.


<ul>
  <li>SD Card writing/reading</li>
  <li>BLE to transfer data to a smart phone</li>
  <li>Temperature, humidity, and pressure measurement</li>
  <li>60+ hour battery life</li>
  <li>E-Ink display</li>
</ul>

One of my favorite additions to this project is the inclusion of pogo pins for the Li-ion battery.  This allows for easy swapping of depleted batteries for the longer trips.
