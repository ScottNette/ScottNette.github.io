<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
I recently moved into a new home and am forced to carry a key with me to unlock/lock the front door.  In my previous home, I would always go through the garage and use the built in garage door opening in my car to get into the house
so I never had this problem.  Seeing as how the COTS bluetooth door unlockers are $200+, I figured I could make mine for under $10.  And I could also add WIFI to it as well, which can alert me if the door is opened via text message or 
allow me to unlock it remotely.  I already had most of the parts needed and access to a 3D printer, which makes this project a much easier to put together
