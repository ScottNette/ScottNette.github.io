This project was inspired by paragliding and my lack of owning a variometer.  Some varios are are couple hundred dollars or so for the ones with a screen and are very helpful for flying cross country.  Then they have the versions that just beep to tell you if you are going up or down.  Goal of this project is to make a tiny solar powered vario with just an audio indicator for accelations up or down.  


Below is the layout for the first version of the device.  Some of the features it includes are:
<ul>
  <li>Pressure and Temperature </li>
  <li>6 axis IMU </li>
  <li>Solar and USB Charging</li>
  <li>400mAh Lipo</li>
  <li>60+ hour battery life</li>
  <li>Battery monitor system</li>
  <li>Audio using a small speaker</li>
</ul>
